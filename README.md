### TASKS
Explored unsupervised learning techniques using synthetic data, images, and sensor datasets to simulate AR/VR tasks.

---

### ✅ Task 1: K-Means vs DBSCAN  
- Clustered synthetic datasets (`blobs`, `moons`)  
- Compared K-Means (good for round clusters) and DBSCAN (detects noise & irregular shapes)

### ✅ Task 2: Image Segmentation  
- Applied K-Means to image pixels  
- Segmented images by color  
- Explored different `k` values & color spaces

### ✅ Task 3: PCA vs t-SNE  
- Reduced Iris dataset to 2D  
- Compared PCA (linear) vs t-SNE (nonlinear)  
- Visualized class separation

### ✅ Task 4: Sensor Data Clustering  
- Used UCI HAR dataset (accel + gyro)  
- Preprocessed & clustered with K-Means, DBSCAN  
- Visualized using PCA & t-SNE

### ✅ Task 5: AR Simulation  
- Drew bounding boxes on segmented clusters  
- Used OpenCV for overlaying cluster zones  
- Simulated AR feedback on objects

### ✅ Task 6: Real GitHub Repo  
- Cloned and ran a segmentation repo  
- Tried different `k`, image sizes  
- Learned from real-world code
